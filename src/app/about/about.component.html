          <h2>VERMEG / EPI Intership Program</h2>
          <p>Many students work during college, but coordinating your job with your class schedule can be tricky. Luckily, students
          who earn money through the Federal Work-Study program may find that their jobs are convenient (often right on campus)
          and accommodating of their academic demands. Plus, whether theyâ€™re serving their school community by helping out at the
          library, or assisting a professor with important research, these students are gaining valuable experiences.</p>
